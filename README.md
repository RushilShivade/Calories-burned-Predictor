# Calories-burned-Predictor
An application developed via StreamLit that predicts the calories burned using Machine Learning.

This project uses the Random Forest Regressor to implement the prediction of calories burnt. The user has to input parameters like age, BMI, gender, weight, time, body weight etc. and the model will predict the calories burnt over the duration of workout. 

Random Forest Regressor: Random Forest Regression is a supervised learning algorithm that uses ensemble learning method for regression. Ensemble learning method is a technique that combines predictions from multiple machine learning algorithms to make a more accurate prediction than a single model.

STREAMLIT: Streamlit is a free and open-source framework to rapidly build and share beautiful machine learning and data science web apps. It is a Python-based library specifically designed for machine learning engineers.
